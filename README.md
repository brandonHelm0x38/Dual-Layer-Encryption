# Dual-Layer-Encryption
A C++ encryption/decryption program.  The initial version will not restore the extension of the original file and so only works on .txt files.  I need to add logic to capture and encrypt the extension type, mask that in a generated string, and create parsing logic to retrieve it for this to work on all file types by default.
